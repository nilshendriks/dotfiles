## Overview

NS Toolkit - Mesh Cleanup Pro is a lightweight, **completely free** Blender add-on that streamlines mesh optimization workflows. Built with performance and reliability in mind, it uses advanced bmesh operations for fast, context-independent mesh processing.

**Perfect for game developers, 3D artists, architects, and anyone working with imported or complex geometry.**

## Key Features

### **Real-Time Topology Visualization**
- **Scene-wide highlighting** - Visualize ALL mesh objects simultaneously
- **Smart color coding**: Blue = N-gons, Red = Triangle-dominant, Green = Quad-dominant
- **Live updates** - Real-time feedback in both Edit and Object modes
- **Non-intrusive** - Doesn't clutter your undo history

### **Optimized Mesh Cleanup Engine**
1. **Smart Triangles to Quads** - Advanced bmesh.ops conversion algorithms
2. **Precise Vertex Merging** - Configurable distance threshold for duplicate removal
3. **Consistent Normal Calculation** - Automatic outside-facing normal correction
4. **Custom Normal Reset** - Clean slate for proper lighting calculations

All operations use **bmesh.ops** for maximum performance and reliability - no context-dependent operators!

### **Clean & Intuitive Interface**
- **Sidebar Integration**: Access via N-Panel under "NS Toolkit" tab
- **One-click operations** - "Clean Mesh" button handles everything
- **Simple feedback** - Concise success messages without clutter
- **Keyboard shortcut**: `Ctrl + Alt + J` for quick access
- **Batch processing**: Handle multiple selected objects at once

### **Performance & Reliability** 
- **Lightweight package**: Only 8.7KB - 74% smaller than previous versions
- **bmesh.ops powered**: No UI context dependencies, works in any situation  
- **Memory efficient**: Proper cleanup and error handling
- **Undo support**: Main cleanup operations integrate with Blender's undo system

## System Requirements

- **Blender**: 4.2.0 or higher
- **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Package Size**: 8.7KB (lightweight!)
- **Dependencies**: None - uses Blender's built-in bmesh module

---

## Installation

1. **Blender Extensions**: Search "NS Toolkit" in `Edit > Preferences > Get Extensions`
2. **Enable**: Find "NS Toolkit - Mesh Cleanup Pro" and enable it
3. **Access**: Open sidebar (N-key) → "NS Toolkit" tab
4. **Ready!** Start cleaning your meshes

---

## How to Use

### Quick Workflow:
1. **Select** mesh object(s) in your scene
2. **Open** sidebar (N-key) → "NS Toolkit" tab  
3. **Optional**: Enable "Highlight All Objects" to see topology across your entire scene
4. **Adjust** merge distance if needed (default: 0.0001 works for most cases)
5. **Click** "Clean Mesh" button
6. **Done!** Get simple success notification: "Cleaned X mesh(es) successfully"

### Topology Visualization:
- **Blue objects** = Have N-gons (5+ sided faces) 
- **Red objects** = Triangle-dominant meshes
- **Green objects** = Quad-dominant meshes (optimal topology)
- **Live updates** = See changes instantly as you edit

### Pro Tips:
- Use **Ctrl + Alt + J** for quick cleanup access
- **Merge distance**: Start with 0.0001, increase for rougher meshes
- **Batch processing**: Select multiple objects for simultaneous cleanup
- **Real-time preview**: Enable highlighting before cleanup to see what needs fixing

## Perfect For

- **Game Development**: Clean imported CAD/FBX models for game engines
- **Architecture**: Process BIM and CAD models for clean visualization
- **3D Printing**: Ensure watertight geometry before slicing
- **Animation**: Prepare meshes for subdivision surfaces and rigging
- **Asset Creation**: Convert triangulated meshes to quad-based topology
- **Import Cleanup**: Fix messy geometry from various 3D software

## Technical Details

### What the Addon Does:
1. **bmesh.ops.join_triangles()** - Intelligently converts triangles to quads
2. **bmesh.ops.remove_doubles()** - Merges vertices within specified distance
3. **bmesh.ops.recalc_face_normals()** - Ensures consistent outside-facing normals
4. **Custom normal cleanup** - Removes custom split normals for clean lighting

### Why bmesh.ops?
- **Faster performance** - Direct mesh data manipulation
- **More reliable** - No dependency on UI context or active objects
- **Better error handling** - Robust operation in any Blender state
- **Memory efficient** - Proper cleanup and resource management

### Merge Distance Guide:
- **0.0001**: High-detail models, precise geometry
- **0.001**: Standard models, most common use case
- **0.01**: Rough imports, larger tolerances needed

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Panel doesn't appear after installation**  
A: Check that the addon is enabled in Preferences > Add-ons, search for "NS Toolkit"

**Q: "No mesh objects selected" warning**  
A: Select at least one mesh object before clicking "Clean Mesh"

**Q: Some triangles remain after cleanup**  
A: This is normal - only triangles that can form proper quads are converted

**Q: Merge distance removes too much detail**  
A: Use smaller values: try 0.0001 for detailed models, 0.001 for general use

**Q: Highlighting colors seem wrong**  
A: Colors show dominant topology: Blue=N-gons present, Red=mostly triangles, Green=mostly quads
