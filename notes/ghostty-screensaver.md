# Ghostty screensaver

Because Ghostty Screensaver is not distributed via the Mac App Store, macOS may block the .saver file when you try to install. To work around this:

    System Settings (macOS Ventura or later):

    Open System Settings → Privacy & Security.
    Scroll down to the “Security” section. You should see a warning about “Ghostty.saver” being blocked.
    Click “Open Anyway” to allow installation.
